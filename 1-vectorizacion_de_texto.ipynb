    "3. Transponer la matriz documento-término. De esa manera se obtiene una matriz término-documento que puede ser interpretada como una colección de vectorización de palabras. Estudiar ahora similaridad entre palabras tomando 5 palabras y estudiando sus 5 más similares. La elección de palabras no debe ser al azar para evitar la aparición de términos poco interpretables, elegirlas \"manualmente\"."

      "wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\n",
      "the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \n",

      "down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \n",
      "balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \n",

      "from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\n",
      "of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\n",
      "I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\n",
      "that woman, because I had just seen that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \n",

      "upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \n",

      "same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\n",
      "through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\n",
      "his mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\n",

      "I am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \n",
      "just have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\n",
      "parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \n",
      "superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \n",
      "everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \n",
      "apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \n",
      "the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \n",
      "in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \n",
      "Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \n",
      "been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \n",
      "ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \n",
      "left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \n",
      "Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \n",
      "straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\n",
      "been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\n",
      "his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \n",
      "them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \n",
      "a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \n",
      "kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \n",
      "there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \n",

      "Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\n",

      "some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\n",
      "of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\n",
      "point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\n",
      "so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\n",

      "with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \n",
      "don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \n",
      "I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \n",
      "not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \n",
      "were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \n",
      "single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \n",
      "all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \n",
      "anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\n",
      "could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\n",
      "know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \n",
      "guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\n",
      "Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\n",
      "only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \n",
      "seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \n",
      "you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \n",
      "people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \n",
      "Armenian?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\n",
      "not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\n",
      "the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\n",
      "When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \n",
      "couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\n",
      "mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \n",
      "did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \n",
      "these women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \n",
      "tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\n",
      "already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \n",
      "cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \n",
      "the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \n",
      "it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \n",
      "were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\n",
      "to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\n",
      "that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \n",
      "was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \n",
      "personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \n",
      "advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \n",
      "tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\n",
      "Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\n",
      "hand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\n",
      "I told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \n",
      "what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \n",
      "traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \n",
      "yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \n",
      "very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \n",
      "expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \n",
      "did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\n",
      "you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\n",
      "to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\n",
      "already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\n",
      "them?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \n",
      "he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \n",
      "and hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \n",
      "didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \n",
      "Muslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\n",
      "guilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \n",
      "us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \n",
      "raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \n",
      "carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \n",
      "then?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \n",
      "anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \n",
      "laughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \n",
      "know what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \n",
      "you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \n",
      "front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \n",
      "over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \n",
      "during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\n",
      "either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \n",
      "away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \n",
      "excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \n",
      "you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \n",
      "That's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \n",
      "party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \n",
      "they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \n",
      "impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \n",
      "days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \n",
      "have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \n",
      "Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \n",
      "them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\n",
      "the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\n",
      "arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\n",
      "the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \n",
      "asked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \n",
      "us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\n",
      "stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \n",
      "General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \n",

      "the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\n",
      "as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \n",
      "he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \n",
      "by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \n",
      "because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \n",
      "and he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\n",
      "horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \n",
      "punished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \n",
      "throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n",
      "\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \n",
      "to calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \n",

      "Subject: Pascal's Wager\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical posting:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\n",
      "but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\n",
      "hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\n",
      "many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\n",
      "described as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\n",
      "follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\n",
      "incorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\n",
      "the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\n",
      "Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\n",
      "favour of prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \n",
      "the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \n",
      "comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \n",
      "is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\n",
      "argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \n",
      "evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \n",
      "cost-benefit analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n",
      "  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n",
      "     exist.\n",
      "  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n",
      "  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\n",
      "assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\n",
      "the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\n",
      "considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\n",
      "information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\n",
      "can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\n",
      "information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\n",
      "no \"cost\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\n",
      "problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\n",
      "Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\n",
      "argument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\n",
      "to believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\n",
      "intended the argument to be viewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\n",
      "omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\n",
      "a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\n",
      "whether people believe in him.\n",

      "\n",
      "People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \n",
      "Razor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \n",
      "unnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\n",
      "the existence of some entity, then do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \n",
      "more generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \n",
      "for what we see around us:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\n",
      "came into being as a result of natural processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \n",
      "there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \n",
      "of non-zero complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \n",
      "that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\n",
      "Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \n",
      "We just imagine that there is.\n",
      "\n",

      "events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\n",
      "QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\n",

      "\n",
      "  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\n",
      "  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\n",

      "  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\n",
      "  for the same person for different machine address email\n",
      "  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\n",

      "  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\n",
      "  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\n",
      "  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \n",
      "  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\n",
      "  mentioned above.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\n",
      "  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\n",
      "  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\n",
      "  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\n",
      "  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\n",
      "  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\n",
      "  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \n",
      "  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\n",
      "  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\n",

      "\n",
      "  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\n",

      "Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n",
      "    more.  Is it worth it?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n",
      "    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n",
      "    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n",

      "    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n",

      "    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n",

      "    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n",
      "    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n",

      "    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n",
      "    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n",
      "    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n",
      "    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n",

      "Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n",
      "    How often should I change my oil?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n",
      "    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n",
      "    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n",

      "    break.  What's the story?\n",
      "\n",
      "A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n",
      "    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n",
      "    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n",
      "    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n",
      "    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n",
      "    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n",
      "    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n",
      "    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n",

      "\n",
      "A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n",
      "    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n",
